(* PatExtraction.v

 * Rocq -> OCaml extraction for PatternSpec.
 * Extracts the pattern-match type inference model to PatternModel.ml;
 * committed to repo so test/test_type_safety_conformance.ml can use it for
 * T3-S5 smoke tests.
 *
 * This driver is listed in _CoqProject, so `make -f CoqMakefile` (and so
 * scripts/check-formal-proofs.sh, CI) runs it. The gate re-extracts and
 * compares the result with the committed copy (canonicalised, see
 * scripts/canonicalize-extraction.py); a spec edit that is not propagated
 * fails CI. Regenerate after spec changes:
 *   cd formal/type-safety
 *   rocq makefile -f _CoqProject -o CoqMakefile && make -f CoqMakefile
 *   python3 ../../scripts/canonicalize-extraction.py \
 *     extraction/PatternModel.ml extraction/PatternModel.mli
