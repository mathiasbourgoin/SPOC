# Project History & Acknowledgments

The SPOC and Sarek projects are the result of over a decade of research into high-level abstractions for GPGPU programming.

## Origins
This work originated as part of **Mathias Bourgoin's PhD thesis** at the UPMC-LIP6 laboratory in Paris, France. The initial research was partially funded by the [OpenGPU](http://opengpu.net/) project.

## Development Timeline
- **2011 - 2013**: Initial development at UPMC-LIP6 (Paris).
- **2014 - 2015**: Continued research at the [Verimag](http://www-verimag.imag.fr) laboratory (Grenoble, France).
- **2015 - 2018**: Extended development at the [LIFO](http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/) laboratory (Orléans, France).
- **2024 - Present**: Significant modernization for OCaml 5 and new GPU backends.

## Current Status
I currently work at [Nomadic Labs](https://nomadic-labs.com) and continue to maintain Sarek as an open-source project. 

The recent modernization efforts (2024-2026) were completed with assistance from AI agents, focusing on OCaml 5 compatibility, plugin-based architecture, and comprehensive test coverage.
