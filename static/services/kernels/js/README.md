The iocamljs kernels, which are the main output of the project live here.

**Note:** The kernel JavaScript files (*.js) are build artifacts and not committed to git.
They are generated during the build process and ignored via .gitignore.

At the moment we generate several kernels:

- `kernel.min.js` - minimum top level with (almost) nothing built in
- `kernel.full.js` - top level with lwt, js\_of\_ocaml and camlp4 syntax extensions
- `kernel.core.js` - core kernel functionality
- `kernel.spoc.js` - SPOC/Sarek kernel
- `kernel.spoc.array2015.js` - SPOC kernel with array2015 support

When used with iocamlserver it will know what kernel to run based on
command line arguments.

For use with an IPython installation rename one of these files to `kernel.js`

## Building

These files are generated by the Jupyter/iocaml build process and should not be
committed to the repository. If you need to rebuild them, follow the iocaml-kernel
build instructions.
